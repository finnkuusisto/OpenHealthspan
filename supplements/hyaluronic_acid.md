# Hyaluronic Acid
Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide with high viscosity in water.
It is found in every connective tissue and organ in the human body, and is a primary component of synovial fluid.
It is cheap and safe to consume.

## What Dose and Why?
400 mg/day

This is based on a review of oral HA for knee pain.
Much smaller effective doses were noted in that trial with 200mg being near the highest dose reviewed.
It's safe and cheap though, so a high dose seems totally reasonable.

This is a review of several mostly double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral hyaluronic acide in patients with osteoarthritis.
Doses varied from 48 mg/day to 240 mg/day.
In effectively every trial reviewed, results indicated that oral HA significantly improved measures of pain, function, and joint effusion over placebo.
Notably, none of the human trials reviewed demonstrated any adverse events related to HA treatment.
