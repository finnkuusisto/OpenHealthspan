### A simple practice guide for dose conversion between animals and human
> Nair AB, Jacob S. A simple practice guide for dose conversion between animals and human. J Basic Clin Pharm. 2016 Mar;7(2):27-31. doi: 10.4103/0976-0105.177703. PMID: 27057123; PMCID: PMC4804402.

Doses in animal studies are often given in mg/kg/day like form.
What does that mean for humans who are typically very different in size from the study animal?
This paper provides a simple table to translate roughly from study animal to human doses.
Some relevant ones below:

| Animal | Divide Dose By |
| --- | --- |
| Human | - |
| Mouse | 12.3 |
| Rat | 6.2 |
