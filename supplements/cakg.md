# Calcium α-Ketoglutarate
Overview here

## What Dose and Why?
1000 mg/day

There isn't a lot of support in humans yet.
I'm roughly basing this on the dose in the Rejuvant paper

### Rejuvant®, a potential life-extending compound formulation with alpha-ketoglutarate and vitamins, conferred an average 8 year reduction in biological aging, after an average of 7 months of use, in the TruAge DNA methylation test
> Demidenko O, Barardo D, Budovskii V, Finnemore R, Palmer III FR, Kennedy BK, Budovskaya YV. Rejuvant®, a potential life-extending compound formulation with alpha-ketoglutarate and vitamins, conferred an average 8 year reduction in biological aging, after an average of 7 months of use, in the TruAge DNA methylation test. Aging (albany NY). 2021 Nov 11;13(22):24485.

This was a company-sponsored study measuring a methylation measure of aging in humans.
Not blinded or controlled and no functional measures.
Dose was 1000mg/day of Ca-AKG.
Showed significant reduction of methylation age with supplementation over 7 months.
