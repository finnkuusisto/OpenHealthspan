# Nicotinamide Mononucleotide
Nicotinamide Mononucleotide is a form of vitamin B3 that can be taken orally and does not have the same flushing effect that Niacin has.
It's an important precursor of NAD+.
There's a ton of research on this one, especially since around 2020, so it's hard to keep track of all the measured effects.
Lots of mouse studies seem to show it reduces negative effects of aging.
There are far fewer studies on humans (some below) but many are in the works.

## What Dose and Why?
500 mg/day

This is largely a balance of cost, observed efficacy, and adverse effect avoidance.
500mg/day is close to the middle dose of the runner study, which was the minimum dose that showed a significant effect.
For now, I'm leaning toward minimum effective dose as a matter of risk-avoidance and cost.

This is a human study of young to middle-aged amateur runners (mostly men).
Three doses (split bi-daily) were tried against a placebo control: 300mg/day, 600mg/day, 1200mg/day.
The trial lasted 6 weeks.
Results showed dose-dependent improvement in ventilatory threshold, though lowest dose (300 mg/day) showed no significant effect.
No adverse effects were observed.

This is a human study of healthy older men.
They used a dose of 250mg/day measuring results at 6 and 12 weeks.
It was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.
Results showed no difference in skeletal muscle mass or liver and visceral fat, but did show an improvement in gait speed and grip test with stronger effect at 12 weeks.
They also observed but found no significant difference in vascular or congitive function.
NMN treatment was well-tolerated.

Long-Term Administration of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Mitigates Age-Associated Physiological Decline in Mice. Cell Metab. 2016 Dec 13;24(6):795-806. doi: 10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.013. Epub 2016 Oct 27. PMID: 28068222; PMCID: PMC5668137.

This study looked at long-term effects of NMN on age-associate pathophysiologies in mice over 12 months, from 5 months to 17 months of age.
They tested two doses: 100mg/kg/day, 300mg/kg/day.
These doses equate to approximately 8mg/kg/day (600mg/day for 75kg) and 24mg/kg/day (1800mg/day for 75kg) in humans (see [Other Refs](/supplements/other_refs.md)).
Results showed a reduction in age-associated weight gain in NMN treated mice vs control (stronger effect in higher dose).
Measured by energy expenditure and physical activity, results showed preventive effects against age-associated metabolism impairment in NMN treated mice.
Also observed improved insulin sensitivity and intrahepatic triglyceride levels, as well as bone mineral density.
Most results showed a dose-dependent response with greater improvement in higher doses.
