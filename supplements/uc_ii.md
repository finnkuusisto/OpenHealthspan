# Undenatured Collagen Type II
Collagen type II is the collagen found in hyaline cartilage.
This is the firmer articular cartilage that makes up your joints.

## What Dose and Why?
40 mg/day

This is a result of 40mg being the typical dose sold and it being the dose used in a clinical trial comparing UC-II with Glucosamine Chondroitin.

This is a clinical trial with two treatment arms: Glucosamine 1500mg/day + Chondroitin 1200mg/day and UC-II 40mg/day.
Results showed significant improvements for the UC-II arm over the G+C arm in WOMAC, VAS, and Lesquesne's scores at 90 days.
The UC-II group also demonstrated fewer adverse events.

This is a fairly small clinical trial of 39 patients with KOA.
There were two treatment arms: 1500mg/day acetaminophen and 1500mg/day acetaminophen + 10mg/day UC-II.
Significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life were observed in the combination group, with far fewer improvements shown in the acetaminophen only group.
Note this did not include a UC-II only or placebo arm, but it does suggest UC-II has an effect that pain killers alone don't.
