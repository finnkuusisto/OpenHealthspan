# L-Theanine
L-Theanine is an amino acid.
It is generally recognized as safe by the FDA at a dose of up to 250mg per serving.

## What Dose and Why?
200 mg/day

This was the dose used in a study of the effects of theanine and caffeine on several cognitive tests.
I take this in the morning and typically consume caffeine through coffee or a preworkout.
I don't feel the need for additional caffeine to potentially gain combination effects.

This is a small human study comparing the effects of L-theanine (200mg), caffeine (160mg), their combination, black tea (one cup), and a placebo (distilled water) on cognitive tests.
Results showed that theanine significantly improved recognition visual reaction time over placebo, as did theanine/caffeine combination.
Theanine, caffeine, and theanine/caffeine combination also showed significantly larger peak-to-peak N2-P300 ERP amplitudes that placebo.
Generally seems theanine (and combo with caffeine) can improve attention.
