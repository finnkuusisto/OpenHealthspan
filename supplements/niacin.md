### Vascular endothelial function and oxidative stress are related to dietary niacin intake among healthy middle-aged and older adults
> Kaplon RE, Gano LB, Seals DR. Vascular endothelial function and oxidative stress are related to dietary niacin intake among healthy middle-aged and older adults. Journal of applied physiology. 2014 Jan 15;116(2):156-63.

This study looked at daily dietary intake of niacin rather than supplementation in humans.
It compared high-intake (>= 22mg/day) to low-intake (< 22mg/day) in healthy middle-aged to older adults.
Results showed greater brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, a common measure of endothelium-dependent dilation, in the high-intake group.
Results also showed decreased LDL and lower oxidative stress in the high-intake group.
Overal positive effect of higher dietary intake of niacin.
