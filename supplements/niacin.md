# Niacin
Nicain is a form of vitamin B3.
High doses cause flushing.

## What Dose and Why?
200 mg/day

This is a substantially higher dose than observed in a study on vascular function but much lower than typical for hypercholesterolemia or in a study on mitochondrial myopathy.
My choice of dose is an attempt to megadose over what was shown for vascular function while also staying below much higher doses that are demonstrated safe but come with some uncomfortable side effects.

This study looked at niacin supplementation in patients with mitochondrial myopathy compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls.
Dose was increased over several months to 750-1000mg and measures were compared to baseline at 4 and 10 months.
There were several outcomes measured, but importantly patients showed a decrease in hepatic and visceral fat, increased muscle mass, increased muscle strength, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.
Some apparent downregulation of mTOR as well.
Note that this was primarily a study for patients with mitochondrial myopathy, but the healthy controls who also received niacin showed improvements in some of these measures as well.
Flushing and gastrointestinal discomfort were common.

### Vascular endothelial function and oxidative stress are related to dietary niacin intake among healthy middle-aged and older adults

This study looked at daily dietary intake of niacin rather than supplementation in humans.
It compared high-intake (>= 22mg/day) to low-intake (< 22mg/day) in healthy middle-aged to older adults.
Results showed greater brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, a common measure of endothelium-dependent dilation, in the high-intake group.
Results also showed decreased LDL and lower oxidative stress in the high-intake group.
Overal positive effect of higher dietary intake of niacin.
